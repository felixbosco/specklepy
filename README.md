# Specklepy - A versatile tool for analyzing astronomical short-exposure ("speckle") data

Specklepy is a versatile tool for data reduction and image reconstruction of short-exposure ("speckle") data. It also contains a module for generating synthetic observations, which is derived from the VegaPy package.

## Installation
The source code of Specklepy is available at github and can be downloaded by cloning the git repository to an arbitrary directory.
`cd` to the directory of choice and execute:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/felixbosco/specklepy.git
```

It is recommended to install Specklepy with `pip`. If `pip` is not available to you, you can also execute the setup 
script. This should work in the same way but has not been tested extensively.
```bash
pip install .
python setup.py install
```

This installation also creates all the binary scripts that are described below. You may want to double check whether 
the installation was successful by calling one of the scripts with the `--help` flag:
```bash
specklepy -h
```

For updating your Specklepy to the latest version, just `git pull` and repeat `pip install .` or `python setup.py install`.

## Data reduction
The data reduction with Specklepy is divided in two steps: Setup and execution. For setting up the files table and 
parameter file, execute the `specklepy reduce` command.
```bash
specklepy reduce --setup -i your_instrument -p path/to/your/files/ -o files.tab
```

This gathers files located at `--path` and saves the list to the `--outfile`.
Note that this function already inspects the fits headers for information on the respective observational setup.
For reading in the file headers properly you have to provide the `--instrument`.
If this step is not working properly, you can adopt the configuration file `specklepy/config/instruments/cfg`.

The actual reduction is then executed by calling the reduction script.
```bash
specklepy reduce your_parameter_file.par
```

## Image reconstruction
The image reconstruction module is the core of Specklepy, thus referred to as `core`.
Available reconstructions are the simple shift-and-add (SSA) algorithm and speckle holography.

#### SSA reconstruction
The SSA reconstruction does not take many parameters but reconstructs an image from the input files, specified with the 
`--file` flag. Temporary files are saved to the `--tmpDir` directory and the reconstruction is saved to the `--outfile`.
```
specklepy ssa your_files_*.fits -t tmp/ -o your_files_ssa.fits
```

#### Holographic reconstruction
For a holographic reconstruction, you can gather all your parameters in a parameter file and execute the script from 
your working directory:
```
specklepy holography your_parameter_file.ini
```

An example parameter file is following `INI` structure. Note that the inDir is guiding to a path and the bash `*` may 
be used to collect all files matching to the description.
```
[PATHS]
inDir = your_input_files_*.fits # May contain the bash *
outFile = holographic_reconstruction.fits
tmpDir = tmp/
allStarsFile = all_sources.dat
refSourceFile = ref_sources.dat

[STARFINDER]
starfinderFwhm = 5 # pixels
signalToNoiseThreshold = 5  # multiples of sigma

[PSFEXTRACTION]
psfRadius = 45
noiseReferenceMargin = 3
noiseThreshold = 1  # multiples of standard deviation

[APODIZATION]
type = Gaussian # Gaussian or Airy
radius = 1.645 # Standard dev of Gaussian or first zero of Airy disk in pixels
```

## Synthetic image generator
The `synthetic` module is capable of creating synthetic observations from parameter files and reference PSF data, 
especially short-exposure 'speckle' PSFs. The principle code is borrowed from VegaPy, the Virtual Exposure Generator 
for Astronomy in Python, but the code received multiple accelerations and features. A strong focus of the changes with 
respect to VegaPy was put on readability of the code and documentation.

For generating exposures just execute the binary:
```bash
specklepy generate your_parameter_file.par
```

The parameter files follow `INI` structure syntax and are interpreted by the package parameter file reader. Quantities 
can be provided with units and the code translates them into `astropy.quantities`, using the `astropy.units` package. 
If no unit is provided, the objects usually interpret the values in default units. In the example below, the 
`sky_background = 14.4` will be interpreted in units mag / arcsec^2. We refer to the doc-strings in the code for 
further details. A parameter file could look like this:
```
[TARGET]
band = 'H'
star_table = your_star_table.dat
sky_background = 14.4

[TELESCOPE]
diameter = 8.2 m
central_obscuration = 0.14
name = VLT Unit Telescope
psf_source = AiryDisk  # Can be 'AiryDisk', 'Gaussian' or the name of a FITS file containing PSFs
psf_resolution = 20.5 mas
radius = 50.6 mas  # Radius of first zero of an AiryDisk or standard deviation of a 2D Gaussian

[DETECTOR]
shape = (1024, 1024)
pixel_scale = 0.01 arcsec
dark_current = 0.1 electron/ s
readout_noise = 35 electron
system_gain = 17 electron/ adu
optics_transmission = 0.9
quantum_efficiency = 0.9 electron/ ph
saturation_level = 60000 electron

[PARAMETERS]
exposure_time = 1.2 s  # Discrete integration time
n_frames = 100  # Number of frames to generate
n_frames_limit = 100  # Maximum number of frames per file
outfile = airy_1200ms.fits
time_stamp = None
dithers = [(0, 0)]
cards={'OBJECT': 'SYNTHETIC', 'OBSTYPE': 'SCIENCE'}

## Development:
These are the current To-Do items:
* General:
  * ~~**low priority:** Create general script with signature "specklepy holography -f ..."~~
  * ~~**low priority:** Make command line arguments to positional arguments for required args~~
  * Transform config parameter sets into multilevel dictionaries
* data reduction module:
  * ~~Flatfield correction from flat frames~~
  * Extend scalar sky subtraction from the images to two-dimensional sky estimates (from sky frames)
  * Linearity correction (wait for D. Thompson)
* core module:
  * Division of the field of view into chunks with separate PSFs for consideration of variable PSFs.
  * Propagation of uncertainties if provided
  * Measure "PSF quality" and implement a weighting scheme for frames
  * Reconstruction modes that return reconstructions that cover the 'same' field of view as a reference, the 'full' field of view covered by at least one exposure or (**low priority:**) 'valid' field of view that is covered by all exposures
  * Secondary source subtraction for holography function
  * Bootstrap resampling for estimating the photo- and astrometric uncertainties
  * Add a call of starfinder after the last iteration of the scripts to save the results
  * **low priority:** Apertures need to throw errors, when the aperture is touching the image edge! This may also be solved by masking the missing data
  * **low priority:** Tune star finder routines
  * **low priority:** Implement frame save mode, which saves the Fourier transformed images and PSFs to files and then just sums up within a tmp file. This is necessary for "bootstrap resampling", which can deliver uncertainties.
* synthetic exposures module:
  * Study whether it makes sense to sample the speckle PSF down before convolution
